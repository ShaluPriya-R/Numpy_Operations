## Aggregation operations 
   Aggregation operations such as finding the maximum and minimum values in an array are common tasks in data analysis and numerical computing. NumPy provides convenient functions like max() and min() for these operations, along with utilities like np.ones() and np.zeros() for creating arrays with specific values.

## Slicing Operations
   Slicing operations allow for selecting specific portions of an array. NumPy supports slicing using standard Python syntax, enabling users to extract subsets of data efficiently.

## Broadcasting Operations
   Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform element-wise operations on arrays with different shapes. It automatically adjusts the shape of arrays to make their dimensions compatible for operations, simplifying array arithmetic.

## Array Manipulation
   Array manipulation operations include reshaping, flattening, and concatenating arrays. These operations are useful for transforming arrays to match the required format for various computations or data processing tasks.

## Array Comparison
   NumPy supports element-wise comparison of arrays using comparison operators like >, <, ==, etc. This allows for logical operations and filtering based on specific conditions.

## Array Indexing and Fancy Indexing
   NumPy provides versatile indexing capabilities, including basic indexing, slicing, and fancy indexing. Fancy indexing allows for selecting elements using arrays of indices, providing flexibility in data manipulation and analysis.

## Mathematical Functions
    NumPy offers a wide range of mathematical functions for element-wise operations on arrays. These functions include trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), exponential and logarithmic functions, and more, enabling complex mathematical computations with ease.

## Linear Algebra
 NumPy provides comprehensive support for linear algebra operations, including matrix multiplication, determinant calculation, eigenvalue decomposition, and solving linear equations. These functionalities are essential for various scientific and engineering applications.

## Statistics
  NumPy offers functions for statistical calculations, such as computing mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of arrays. These functions facilitate data analysis and summarization, providing insights into the distribution and characteristics of the data.

## Random Sampling
  NumPy provides utilities for generating random numbers and random samples from different probability distributions. Random sampling is useful for simulations, statistical modeling, and generating synthetic data for testing and experimentation.
